                Standard ML is a safe, modular, strict, functional, polymorphic
                programming language with compile-time type checking
                and type inference,
                garbage collection, exception handling,
                immutable data types and updatable references,
                abstract data types, and parametric modules.  
                It has efficient implementations and a formal definition
                with a proof of soundness.

                <dl>
                <dt><strong>Safe</strong><dd>
                ML is safe, in that a program that passes the type-checker
                cannot dump core, access private fields of abstract data types,
                mistake integers for pointers, or otherwise "go wrong."

                <dt><strong>Modular</strong><dd>
                The Standard ML module system supports modules (called <i>structures</i>)
                and interfaces (called <i>signatures</i>); the signature of a module
                determines what components and types from the module are visible
                from outside.  There is a flexible system for matching structures
                to signatures: there can be several different views (signatures)
                of the same structure, and there can be several different
                implementations (structures) matching the same signature.

                <dt><strong>Functional</strong><dd>
                ML has higher-order functions:  functions can be passed
                as arguments, stored in data structures, and returned as results
                of function calls.  Functions can be statically nested within 
                other functions; this lexical scoping mechanism gives the ability
                to create "new" functions at run time.

                <dt><strong>Strict</strong><dd>
                Function calls in ML, like those of C, Pascal, C++, Java, etc., evaluate
                their arguments before entering the body of the function.
                Such a language is called <i>strict</i> or <i>call-by-value</i>,
                in contrast to some functional programming languages that
                are <i>lazy</i> or <i>call-by-need</i>.  Strict evaluation makes it
                easier for the programmer to reason about the execution of the program.

                <dt><strong>Polymorphic</strong><dd>
                ML supports polymorphic functions and data types.  
                Data-type polymorphism
                allows a single type declaration (such as "list") to describe
                lists of integers, lists of strings, lists of lists of integers, and so on;
                but the programmer can be assured that, given an "int list",
                every element really is an "int".  Function polymorphism allows
                a single function declaration (such as filter_list) to operate on
                lists of integers, lists of strings, lists of integer-lists,
                and so on, avoid needless duplication of code.

                <dt><strong>Compile-time type checking</strong><dd>
                Programmers in compile-time type-checked languages get the
                benefit not only of faster execution but also less debugging:
                many of the programmer's mistakes can be caught early in the
                development process; and the types may lead to clearer thinking about
                the program's specification.

                <dt><strong>Type inference</strong><dd>
                The ML programmer need not write down the type of every
                variable and function-parameter: the compiler can usually
                calculate the type from context.  This makes programs more
                concise and easier to write.

                <dt><strong>Garbage collection</strong><dd>
                Automatic deallocation of unreachable data makes programs
                simpler, cleaner, and more reliable.

                <dt><strong>Exception handling</strong><dd>
                ML's exception-handling mechanism -- similar to the ones
                in C++, Java, Ada, etc. -- provides dynamic nesting of handlers
                and eliminates the need for ad hoc, special exceptional
                return values from functions.

                <dt><strong>Immutable data types</strong><dd>
                In ML, most variables and
                data structures -- once created and initialized -- are
                <i>immutable</i>, meaning that they are never changed, updated, or
                stored into.  This leads to some powerful guarantees of noninterference
                by different parts of the program operating on those data structures.
                In a functional language such as ML, one tends to build new data
                structures (and let the old ones be garbage collected) instead of
                modifying old ones.

                <dt><strong>Updatable references</strong><dd>
                However, ML does have updatable (assignable) <i>reference</i> types,
                so that in those cases where destructive update is the most natural
                way to express an algorithm, one can express it directly.

                <dt><strong>Abstract data types</strong><dd>
                ML supports information hiding, so that one can implement a data
                type whose representation is hidden by an interface that just exports
                functions to construct and operate on the type.

                <dt><strong>Parametric modules</strong><dd>
                A <i>functor</i> is an ML program module takes the signature 
                of another module as an argument.  The functor can then be applied to
                any module matching that signature.  This facility is like the
                <i>template</i> of C++ or the <i>generic</i> of Ada or Modula-3,
                but in ML the functor can be completely type-checked and compiled
                to machine code before it is applied to its argument(s); this leads
                to better program modularity.

                <dt><strong>Efficient implementations</strong><dd>
                Features such as polymorphism, parametric modules, and a heavy
                reliance on garbage collection have meant that compiling ML to efficient
                machine code requires techniques not usually necessary in C compilers.
                Several Standard ML 
                compilers generate high-quality machine code, including 
                <a href="index.html">Standard ML of New Jersey</a> and
                <a href="http://www.harlequin.com/products/ads/ml/">Harlequin ML Works</a>.

                <dt><strong>Formal definition</strong><dd>
                The ML language is clearly specified by 
                <a href="http://mitpress.mit.edu/book-home.tcl?isbn=0262631814"><I>The Definition of Standard ML
                (Revised)</I> (Milner, Tofte, Harper, MacQueen, MIT Press, 1997)</a>,
                which defines the language in 93 pages of mathematical notation and
                English prose.  This book is not meant for the casual reader, but
                it is accessible to the serious student of programming languages and
                its existence and accessibility provide an implementation-independent
                formulation of Standard ML.

                <dt><strong>Proof of soundness</strong><dd>
                A consequence of having the language definition in a formal notation
                is that one can 
                <a href="http://simon.trinhall.cam.ac.uk/~mvi20/papers/JAR.html">prove 
                important properties of the language</a>, such as 
                deterministic evaluation or soundness of type-checking.
